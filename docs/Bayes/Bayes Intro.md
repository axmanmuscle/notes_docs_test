## Introduction to Bayes
This will be about _Bayesian Statistics_, a branch of statistics (more like a philosophy) that uses Bayes' Theorem to think about statistical problems. 

## To Do
 1. Introduction to Bayes
 1. Normal Modeling (write out normal with unknown mean, unknown std dev., both)
 1. Hierarchical modeling (write out a model here?)
 1. Page about distributions (easy to write if you want to spend time on this)
 1. Bayes as logic (from Jaynes/the talk you gave)
 1. Would be fun to do software examples
 1. List of conjugate distributions would be nice
