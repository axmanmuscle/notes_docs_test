## General Notes Landing Page
hello

## To Do

Just make this your main notes repo and nuke the other 2, this layout is just much nicer.

Here's a list of things to try to accomplish:
 1. Make this the primary "notes" repo on your github.
 1. Add in pictures and a Favicon
 1. Figure out how to host PDFs
 1. Maybe see if you can dork with the theme, even though it looks nice as is
 1. Write out a list of things you want to discuss (Bayes?)
 1. Figure out how to link posts?
