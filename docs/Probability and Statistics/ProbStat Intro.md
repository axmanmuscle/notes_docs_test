## Introduction to Probability and Statistics
This will be about _Probability and Statistics_, where I will detail some stuff I find interesting in the probability and statistics region.

## To Do
 1. Introduction to Prob/Stat
 1. Use some stuff from Jem's book esp. difference between probability and statistics
 1. Useful ideas/theorems (LOTUS, Kolmogorov, etc)
 1. MGF/Characteristic Function
 1. Tables of distributions
 1. Tests/likelihood/GLRT?

## Introduction
Probability and statistics play an important role in almost every engineering discipline and application. Noise is present at every level of measurement for every type of application, so estimating parameters from noisy measurements is used everywhere. Just in electrical engineering, this is present in e.g. communications, radar, and imaging.

What I think a lot of books miss is _what_ is the difference between probability and statistics? In my opinion, the answer is simple:

__Probability is about the future. Statistics is about the past.__
