## Laplace Transform
Another useful integral transformations is the _Laplace transform_. 

## To Do
 1. Intro/history? Low prio
 2. Defn
 3. Theorems 
 4. Interpretations

## Definition
Let $x(t)$ be a real valued signal. The _Laplace transform_ of $x$ is

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}\left\\{x\right\\}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}x(t)e^{-st}\mathrm{d}t,
\end{equation}

where $s$ is a complex-valued parameter $s = \sigma + i\omega$.

## Interpretations
One useful thing about these integral transforms, both this and the Laplace transform, is their effect on differential equations. Jaynes talks about this in his theory of probability book (which is excellent).
